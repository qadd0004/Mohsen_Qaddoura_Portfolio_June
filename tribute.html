            <blockquote>
              <p>
                "What I will remember most about Mr. Mandela is that
                he was a man whose heart, soul, and spirit could not
                be contained or restrained by racial and economic
                injustices, metal bars, or the burden of hate and
                revenge. He taught us forgiveness on a grand scale."
